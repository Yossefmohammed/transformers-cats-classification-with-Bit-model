# Transformers Cats Classification with Bit Model

This project implements a cat breed classification system using the Big Transfer (BiT) model from Hugging Face. The model is fine-tuned to classify different types of cats using transfer learning techniques.

## Project Overview

- Utilizes the BiT (Big Transfer) pre-trained model from Hugging Face
- Implements transfer learning for cat breed classification
- Demonstrates the application of transformer models in computer vision tasks

## Features

- Pre-trained model adaptation for cat classification
- Transfer learning implementation
- Image classification capabilities
